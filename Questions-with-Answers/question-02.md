### Answer

The CLI and GUI represent two different approaches to interacting with your PC.

CLI utilizes text-based commands. This gives you precise control, scripting capabilities to automate things, and is very efficient
for things like parsing text or fetching information. The downside to the CLI is its learning curve. CLI requires the user to learn
specific commands and syntax and it requires a lifetime of learning in order to continue improving. 

An excellent example of using CLI over a GUI is looking up system or prcess information. A simple keystroke of commands is much faster than navigating though several menus (especially on windows) to find the information. Search and replacing text is another area where the CLI is superior. Using a tool like sed is much faster than copying and pasting manually between documents, especially if there's thousands of lines of text. 

GUIs provide a visual based experience with Graphical menus and mouse/keyboard based navigation. This makes GUIs accessible to a much larger audience and allows users to learn quickly. GUIs are better suited in applications like web browsing or media related apps (such as video streaming).

A good example for why you would choose a GUI over a CLI is something such as Photoshop or video editing. These tasks are more esoteric and are better conveyed using the motions of a mouse rather than typing out text commands. The Menus also allow the information to be presented more organically the way you would in real life.

CLIs and GUIs both have their place and excel in different areas.
