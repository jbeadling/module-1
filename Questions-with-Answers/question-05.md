### Answer

There are many terminal emulators but I will try and list some of the more popular one:

**Terminator**: The most popular feature of Terminator is the ability to arrange terminals in a grid-like structure. Terminator is that it lets you open multiple terminals either in vertical or horizontal mode and monitor the activity of each terminal at the same time. Here are some of the highlights below:

- Multi-grid structure
- Save multiple layouts and profiles
- Terminal reordering using drag and drop
- Third party plugins

**Tabby**: a Terminal emulator which flaunts a modern look, lots of shortcuts, supports almost all shells including the popular ones like Bash, Windows PowerShell, CMD, etc., and is also highly customizable. Some of the features below:

- Cross platform. Can run on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
- Allows multiple nested panes, progress bars, and activity notifications for tabs.
- Lost of customization options and themes.
- Comes with a wide range of shortcuts.

**Cool Retro Term**: Mainly focused on simulating the style of the 90s cathod ray screen with a color variant. This terminal is purely for a 90s aesthetics with CTR monitors. It's not nearly as customizable as some of the other terminals but that's not really it's purpose. Some of the features below:

- Old Cathode display
- Customizable and lightweight
- Vintage visual settings
