### Answer


grep is an incredibly powerful search tool available on unix systems. It is one of the most common tools used by system administrators, developers, and power users alike. It is used for searching text using regular expressions or just words. It is a versatile tool for searching text in files and is commonly used for tasks like log analysis, data extraction, and code searching. It's highly flexible due to its support for regular expressions, and it can be combined with other Unix commands for more advanced text processing.

Below I use grep with the -ir flags to ignore cases and search all files in the directory recursively
