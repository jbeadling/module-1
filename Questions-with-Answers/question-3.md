#### Summary
Compile a comprehensive list of advantages that make Command Line Interface (CLI) a more effective option than Graphical User Interface (GUI) for specific tasks or in certain scenarios.

#### Description
- Objective: To document the key strengths of CLI over GUI in order to inform decision-making for tool selection, project development, or educational content.
- Scope: Focus on the tangible benefits such as performance, resource usage, and specific use-cases where CLI has a clear edge.

#### Tasks
1. Research performance benefits of CLI:
    - Speed
    - Resource consumption
    - Task automation
2. Investigate versatility:
    - How CLI can manage complex tasks with simple commands
    - Batch processing capabilities
3. Examine user control:
    - Granularity of control provided by CLI
    - Capability to perform tasks not possible or too cumbersome in GUI
4. Review community and documentation:
    - Availability of open-source CLI tools
    - Robustness of documentation and community support
5. Compile this information into a well-organized list or report.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- A detailed list or report that fulfills all tasks mentioned.
- Include real-world examples or case studies to substantiate each advantage.
- Ensure information is factual and sourced from credible references.

#### Priority
- Medium

### Answer

The CLI offers several advantages over a GUI especially in tasks dealing with back-end systems. Some of these are:

**Scripting**: You can use scripts to automate everyday tasks, something mandatory for programmers and system administrators. These scripts can also be ported very easily as long as you run a shell that is Bash compatible (most are). 

**Remote Access**: CLI is commonly used for remote access via SSH, especially on systems without a GUI. There are remote tools for GUI but performance wise these are not as efficient. 

**Resource Efficiency**: CLI consumes fewer system resources than a GUI. This is especially useful if you have a low spec device or older system you want to continue using, what will happen is that they might install an OS without a GUI and just use a CLI to interact with it. 

**Resource Monitoring**: The CLI provides tools that give you detailed system and network resource monitoring and these are far better and easier to use than anything on a GUI.

**Server Maintenance**: Even if the Server has a GUI, the CLI is the primary tool that will be used for server maintenance tasks like server updates, configuration changes, and debugging. 

**Headless Operation**: Alot of servers can come headless (which means no GUI installed, just the CLI), this also includes lots of smaller IOT devices. These are all managed exclusively by the CLI.
